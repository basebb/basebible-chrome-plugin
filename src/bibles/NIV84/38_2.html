<h1>Zechariah 2</h1><h2>A Man With a Measuring Line</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Then I looked up—and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand!</span></p><p/><p><span><b>2</b>I asked, “Where are you going?”<br/>He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”</span><span><b>3</b>Then the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel came to meet him</span><span><b>4</b>and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will be its glory within.’</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the Lord, “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the Lord.</span><span><b>7</b>“Come, O Zion! Escape, you who live in the Daughter of Babylon!”</span><span><b>8</b>For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.</span><span><b>10</b>“Shout and be glad, O Daughter of Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the Lord.</span><span><b>11</b>“Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.</span><span><b>12</b>The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.</span></p><p><span><b>13</b>Be still before the Lord, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”</span></p>
