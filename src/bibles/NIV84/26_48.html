Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the LORD.</span><span><b>15</b>“The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it</span><span><b>16</b>and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits.</span><span><b>17</b>The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west.</span><span><b>18</b>What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.</span><span><b>19</b>The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel.</span></p><p><span><b>20</b>The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side.

It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them.</span></p><p><span><b>22</b>So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.</span></p><p><span><b>23</b>“As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side.</span></p><p><span><b>24</b>“Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west.</span></p><p><span><b>25</b>“Issachar will have one portion; it will border the territory of Simeon from east to west.</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>“Zebulun will have one portion; it will border the territory of Issachar from east to west.</span></p><p><span><b>27</b>“Gad will have one portion; it will border the territory of Zebulun from east to west.</span></p><p><span><b>28</b>“The southern boundary of Gad will run south from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi<i> of Egypt</i>to the Great Sea.</span></p><p><span><b>29</b>“This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Sovereign LORD.</span></p><h2>The Gates of the City</h2><p><span><b>30</b>“These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long,</span></p><p><span><b>31</b>the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel.
