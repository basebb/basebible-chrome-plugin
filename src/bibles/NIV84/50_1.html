<h1>Philippians 1</h1><p/><p/><p/><p/><p><span><b>1</b>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><h2>Thanksgiving and Prayer</h2><p><span><b>3</b>I thank my God every time I remember you.</span><span><b>4</b>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy</span><span><b>5</b>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,</span></p><p><span><b>6</b>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>7</b>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</span><span><b>9</b>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,</span><span><b>10</b>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</span></p><p><span><b>11</b>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ–to the glory and praise of God.</span></p><h2>Paul's Chains Advance the Gospel</h2><p><span><b>12</b>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.</span><span><b>13</b>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.</span></p><p><span><b>14</b>Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.</span><span><b>15</b>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.</span><span><b>16</b>The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.</span><span><b>17</b>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.</span></p><p><span><b>18</b>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.<br/>Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</span><span><b>19</b>for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.</span><span><b>20</b>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</span><span><b>21</b>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span><span><b>22</b>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!</span><span><b>23</b>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;</span><span><b>24</b>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.</span><span><b>25</b>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</span></p><p><span><b>26</b>so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.</span><span><b>27</b>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel</span><span><b>28</b>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved–and that by God.</span><span><b>29</b>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,</span></p><p><span><b>30</b>since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</span></p>
