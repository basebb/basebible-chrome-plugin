<h1>Zechariah 3</h1><h2>Clean Garments for the High Priest</h2><p><span><b>1</b>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.</span></p><p><span><b>2</b>The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”</span><span><b>3</b>Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>4</b>The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.”<br/>Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.”</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.</span><span><b>6</b>The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.</span><span><b>8</b>” ‘Listen, O high priest Joshua and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.</span></p><p><span><b>9</b>See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.</span></p><p><span><b>10</b>” ‘In that day each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”</span></p>
