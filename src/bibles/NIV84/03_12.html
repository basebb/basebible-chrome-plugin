<h1>Leviticus 12</h1><h2>Purification After Childbirth</h2><p><span><b>1</b>The Lord said to Moses,</span><span><b>2</b>“Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period.</span><span><b>3</b>On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.</span><span><b>4</b>Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.</span></p><p><span><b>5</b>If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding.</span><span><b>6</b>“ ‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.</span></p><p><span><b>7</b>He shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood.<br/>“ ‘These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.</span></p><p><span><b>8</b>If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’ ”</span></p>
